KMP Algorithm: In computer science, the Knuth–Morris–Pratt string-searching algorithm
        (or KMP algorithm) searches for occurrences of a "word" W within a main 
        "text string" S by employing the observation that when a mismatch occurs, 
        the word itself embodies sufficient information to determine where the next match 
        could begin, thus bypassing re-examination of previously matched characters.

Problem Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%E2%80%93Morris%E2%80%93Pratt_algorithm
Purpose: Pattern searching is an important problem in computer science. 
        When we do search for a string in notepad/word file or browser or 
        database, pattern searching algorithms are used to show the search results.
Method : Dynamic Programming

Time Complexity:  O(N)
Space Complexity: O(N)
Argument : Text(search Domain), Pattern(string to be searched)
Return   : int (index of the first occurrence)
